This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element in a vector using an index that's out of bounds. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which panics when attempting to access the third element of a two-element vector. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that uses safe methods to handle potential index errors.
